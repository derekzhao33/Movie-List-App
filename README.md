# To-watch application

## What will the application do?

This project will keep track of movies that I have watched, am watching, and want to watch in the future. 

There are **3** distinct parts of this project: movies that I have finished watching, ones that I am watching, and ones that I want to watch (to-watch list).

General features:
- Classifying a movie as watched, currently watching, or to-watch
- Writing down notes/reviews
- Searching and filtering by genre
- Stats and insights (total watch time)
- Displaying lists of movies based on genres or whether the movie is in the to-watch, currently watching, or finished list
- Removing from each category 
- Changing movie details
- Adding movies

## Who will use it?

I, and maybe a few friends will be using this application

## Why is this project of interest to you?

I spend a lot of my time watching Movies. I also like to be organized, so it would be nice to have something that could combine these two aspects together. I like how Netflix does their "list", but I don't just watch movies on Netflix, so it would be helpful if I could keep track of movies on various different platforms
