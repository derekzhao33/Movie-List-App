# To-watch application

## What will the application do?

This project will keep track of shows/movies that I have watched, am watching, and want to watch in the future. 

There are **3** distinct parts of this project: shows/movies that I have finished watching, ones that I am watching, and ones that I want to watch (to-watch list).

For shows/movies that I have finished watching, features will include:
- Writing down a review/rating for the show
- Whether I want to rewatch
  - If so, then the show will be re-added to the to-watch list
- Keep track of the date finished/started
- Favorite episode

For shows/movies that I am currently watching:
- Keeping track of what episode and timestamp I am at
- Taking notes
- Streaming platform links
- Auto moving to finished when done the show

For the to-watch list:
- Priority rankings
- Where to watch

General features:
- Searching and filtering
- Stats and insights (total watch time, number of shows completed)
- Displaying lists of shows based on genres or whether the show is in the to-watch, currently watching, or finished list
- Removing from each category 
- Changing show/movie details
- Adding shows/movies

## Who will use it?

I, and maybe a few friends will be using this application

## Why is this project of interest to you?

I spend a lot of my time watching TV shows and movies. I also like to be organized, so it would be nice to have something that could combine these two aspects together. I like how Netflix does their "list", but I don't just watch shows on Netflix, so it would be helpful if I could keep track of movies/shows on various different platforms
