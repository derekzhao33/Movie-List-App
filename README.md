# To-watch application

## What will the application do?

This project will keep track of shows/movies that I have watched, am watching, and want to watch in the future. 

There are **3** distinct parts of this project: shows/movies that I have finished watching, ones that I am watching, and ones that I want to watch (to-watch list).

General features:
- Classifying a movie as watched, currently watching, or to-watch
- Writing down notes/reviews
- Searching and filtering by genre
- Stats and insights (total watch time, number of shows completed)
- Displaying lists of shows based on genres or whether the show is in the to-watch, currently watching, or finished list
- Removing from each category 
- Changing show/movie details
- Adding shows/movies

## Who will use it?

I, and maybe a few friends will be using this application

## Why is this project of interest to you?

I spend a lot of my time watching TV shows and movies. I also like to be organized, so it would be nice to have something that could combine these two aspects together. I like how Netflix does their "list", but I don't just watch shows on Netflix, so it would be helpful if I could keep track of movies/shows on various different platforms

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to create movies/shows with a status, name, and genre, and add it to the list of media items
- As a user, I want to view all movies/shows on the list, and view by genre, their media type, or their status (watched, currently watching, to-watch)
- As a user, I want to add notes, ratings, and watch time for the movies/shows
- As a user, I want to change any details about the movie/show (status, name, genre, notes, ratings, watch time, episode, season)
- As a user, I want to categorize my movie/show as watched, currently watching, or to-watch
